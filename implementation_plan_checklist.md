# Implementation Plan and Checklist for DM Channels

## Overview
This document outlines the plan and checklist for implementing Direct Message (DM) channels in the application. DM channels will be managed similarly to regular channels but with specific adjustments for direct messaging between users.

## Plan

### 1. Database Setup
- [ ] Ensure `dm_channels` and `dm_channel_subscriptions` tables are correctly set up.
- [ ] Add necessary indexes for performance optimization.

### 2. API Endpoints
- [ ] Create `GET /api/dm/channels?userId={userId}` to check for existing DM channels.
- [ ] Create `POST /api/dm/channels` to create new DM channels.
- [ ] Implement error handling and authentication checks.

### 3. Frontend Components
- [ ] Update `DirectMessageSidebar` to handle user clicks for DM initiation.
- [ ] Ensure `DirectMessageView` fetches and displays messages correctly.
- [ ] Integrate WebSocket for real-time message updates.

### 4. WebSocket Integration
- [ ] Set up WebSocket channels for DM communication.
- [ ] Ensure real-time updates for message sending and receiving.

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test API endpoints for correct functionality.
- [ ] Verify frontend components display and interact correctly.
- [ ] Ensure WebSocket updates are real-time and reliable.

## Checklist
- [ ] Database schema for DM channels
- [ ] API endpoints for DM management
- [ ] Frontend integration for DM channels
- [ ] WebSocket setup for real-time updates
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and validation

This checklist will be updated as progress is made and new tasks are identified.
