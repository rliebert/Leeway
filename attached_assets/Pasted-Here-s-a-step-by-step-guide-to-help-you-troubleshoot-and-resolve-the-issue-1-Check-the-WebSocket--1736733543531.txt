Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Check the WebSocket Payload
Ensure that when a message with a file attachment is sent via WebSocket, the file's URL or metadata is correctly included in the payload.
Verify that the URLs are absolute or relative and point to a valid, accessible location.
Key Actions:

Log the WebSocket messages being sent and received.
Confirm that the URLs are valid and in the correct format (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/uploads/file.pdf).
2. Handle File URLs on Refresh
If URLs are dynamically generated, they may not persist correctly after a refresh. This could happen if:
File links are generated in-memory without being saved in a database or persistent storage.
The server doesn't regenerate the URLs consistently on reload.
Key Actions:

Verify that file URLs are stored persistently (e.g., in a database) and retrieved correctly when the chat history is reloaded.
Ensure the frontend fetches the correct attachment data from the server after a refresh.
3. Check File Storage and Retrieval Logic
Ensure that files are stored in a way that can be accessed consistently (e.g., on a CDN, local server, or S3 bucket).
Malformed filenames could indicate an issue with how files are being uploaded or retrieved.
Key Actions:

Test file uploads and downloads directly on the server to verify that file paths are valid.
If you're using an external file storage service, double-check the URL generation logic.
4. Verify URL Encoding/Decoding
Malformed filenames often result from improper encoding or decoding of URLs.
Ensure that filenames with special characters (e.g., spaces, %, etc.) are properly encoded when generating URLs.
Key Actions:

Test filenames with special characters to see if they break.
Use encodeURIComponent() or a similar utility when generating URLs.
5. Frontend Chat History Handling
If the frontend re-renders the chat history on refresh, it must fetch the correct attachment data from the server.
Broken links could result from mismatched or missing metadata.
Key Actions:

Review the logic that fetches chat history after a refresh.
Confirm that file attachment data (URLs, filenames) is included in the fetched data.
6. Server-Side Routing and API Endpoints
Ensure your server correctly serves file URLs when they are requested.
Check for issues like:
Misconfigured file routes or static file serving middleware.
Missing files on the server.
Key Actions:

Test file URLs directly in the browser to confirm they are served properly.
Check server logs for errors related to file serving.
7. Caching Issues
If files are cached incorrectly, it could result in outdated or broken URLs being used.
Key Actions:

Clear the browser cache and retest.
Implement proper cache-busting mechanisms (e.g., query strings with versioning).
8. WebSocket and Backend Sync
Ensure that the WebSocket backend and your persistent storage are in sync. If messages are only stored temporarily in memory, their attachment URLs could be lost after a refresh.
Key Actions:

Persist all chat messages and attachment data in a database.
Confirm that the WebSocket message handler updates the database with the correct data.
Debugging Steps
Frontend Debugging:

Open the browser developer tools.
Monitor the WebSocket messages.
Check the console for errors or warnings related to attachments.
Backend Debugging:

Log incoming WebSocket messages on the server.
Test file URL endpoints to ensure they return the expected files.
Example Fix: Storing Attachment URLs Persistently
If your issue is due to non-persistent attachment URLs, modify your backend to persist the attachment URLs along with the chat messages. For example:

When a file is uploaded, save the file in persistent storage (e.g., S3, database) and generate a public URL.
Save this URL alongside the message in the database.
On frontend refresh, fetch the chat history from the database, including the file URLs.
