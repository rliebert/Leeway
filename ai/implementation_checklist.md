# AI Chatbot Implementation Checklist

## 1. Database Setup
- [x] Enable pgvector extension
- [x] Create message_embeddings table with vector support
- [x] Create index for vector similarity search
- [x] Create ai.rob user in the database

## 2. Dependencies & Configuration
- [x] Install required packages (@langchain/openai, etc.)
- [x] Set up OpenAI API key in environment
- [x] Configure vector store connection
- [x] Implement RAG service with proper embeddings setup

## 3. Core RAG Implementation
- [x] Implement message embedding storage
- [x] Create vector similarity search functionality
- [x] Set up AI response generation with context
- [x] Add question detection logic

## 4. Training Pipeline
- [x] Create training script (scripts/train-embeddings.ts)
- [x] Set up periodic retraining mechanism (1-hour intervals)
- [x] Add admin-triggered retraining endpoint
- [ ] Run initial training on rliebert's message history
- [x] Implement incremental training for new messages

## 5. WebSocket Integration
- [x] Add RAG response generation to message handler
- [x] Implement admin-only retraining trigger
- [x] Set up automatic training schedule
- [ ] Test end-to-end question detection and responses


## 6. Performance & Monitoring
- [x] Add proper error handling
- [x] Track last training timestamp
- [x] Implement optimized retraining checks
- [ ] Add monitoring for embedding storage growth

## Next Actions:
1. Run initial training on rliebert's message history
2. Test the question detection and response generation
3. Monitor and adjust response quality

## Admin Features:
- [x] Add WebSocket command for manual retraining
- [x] Implement admin permission checking
- [x] Add training status feedback
