Prompt:
We're going to use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to add a chatbot user with username "ai.rob", who will reply and answer questions matching as closely as possible how user "rliebert" would answer according to all his previus messages in the app database.  We're going to follow along the two attached guides to apply this type of automated user to the Leeway app.  Please first plan out, step by step, what we need to set up to get this working with our app and database in their current form with minimal tweaks/migrations.  We can use whatever tools/APIs we need from among OpenAI, LangChain, Pinecone, and/or BrainTrust (or any other tools that are necessary according to the guides, but with my approval first if it wasn't one I mentioned).  We will then create a checklist of tasks to get this feature up and running, and walk through it together, step by step.  For now, since DMs are not working properly yet (that's beyond the scope of this task), the way we can implement this feature is to have ai.rob respond to any question (i.e. message that ends with a "?") in any channel's chat.  OK, go.

Answer:
Based on the provided guides and the current codebase, let's plan out implementing RAG-powered AI responses from "ai.rob" that mimic "rliebert's" communication style. Here's the implementation plan:

Setup Steps:
1. Database & Vector Store Setup:
* Create a new table for storing message embeddings
* Set up Neon PostgreSQL vector store (already have PostgreSQL integration)
* Add indexes for vector similarity search

2. Message Processing:
* Create embeddings for all of rliebert's historical messages
* Store these embeddings in the vector store
* Set up real-time message embedding for new messages

3. AI Response System:
* Create ai.rob user in the database
* Implement message pattern detection (questions)
* Set up OpenAI integration for response generation
* Add WebSocket handler for AI responses

Implementation Checklist:
Database Setup:
[ ] Add message_embeddings table
[ ] Add vector similarity search capabilities
[ ] Create ai.rob user
Dependencies & Integration:
[ ] Install LangChain and OpenAI packages
[ ] Set up OpenAI API key in Secrets
[ ] Configure vector store connection
Core Functionality:
[ ] Create message embedding generation service
[ ] Implement question detection
[ ] Add RAG query/response pipeline
[ ] Integrate with WebSocket server
Integration with Existing Code:
[ ] Modify message handling in WebSocket server
[ ] Add AI response triggering logic
[ ] Update frontend to handle AI responses

Let's start with adding the necessary packages and setting up the database structure.

Dependencies:
@langchain/openai
langchain
@pinecone-database/pinecone

First, let's create the ai.rob user and message embeddings table:
db/schema.ts
Add message_embeddings table
Let's create a new service for handling the RAG functionality:
server/services/rag.ts
Create RAG service
Would you like me to continue with implementing the WebSocket integration for AI responses?
