# Project Context Record

## Project Overview
Leeway - A team communication platform built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Authentication System:
   - Uses Passport.js with local strategy
   - Password hashing with scrypt
   - Session management with Express session and MemoryStore
   - Username-based authentication

2. Database Structure:
   - PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
   - Explicit table relationships
   - Auto-incrementing serial IDs
   - Schema managed through Drizzle migrations

3. Frontend Architecture:
   - React with TypeScript
   - Client-side auth context with @tanstack/react-query
   - Shadcn/UI components
   - Wouter for routing
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

## Current Implementation Status
1. Completed:
   - User authentication (username/password)
   - Channel management with sections
   - Drag-and-drop channel organization
   - Real-time messaging
   - File uploads
   - Message search functionality
   - Direct messaging interface
   - Responsive sidebar layout

2. In Progress:
   - Message threads and replies
   - User presence indicators
   - File attachment previews
   - Message reactions

## Critical Implementation Details
1. Auth Flow:
   - Authentication state managed through useUser hook
   - Session persistence with Express session
   - Protected routes and API endpoints

2. Database Access:
   - Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
   - Foreign key relationships enforced
   - Automatic schema synchronization

3. Security Considerations:
   - Password hashing with scrypt
   - Session-based authentication
   - Protected API routes
   - Secure WebSocket connections

## Known Issues
1. Authentication:
   - Session management needs optimization for scale
   - Password reset functionality not implemented

2. Real-time Features:
   - WebSocket reconnection handling needs improvement
   - Message delivery confirmation pending

## Next Steps
1. Messaging:
   - Implement thread replies
   - Add emoji reactions
   - Message editing and deletion
   - Message delivery status

2. User Experience:
   - Add user presence indicators
   - Implement typing indicators
   - Add file preview capabilities
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

3. Performance:
   - Implement message pagination
   - Optimize WebSocket connections
   - Add caching layer

## Development Environment
1. Required Services:
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Node.js runtime
   - File storage system

2. Environment Variables:
   - DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL connection
   - Session secret
   - File storage configuration

## Common Issues/Solutions
1. Database Synchronization:
   - Use `npm run db:push` to sync schema changes
   - Check foreign key constraints
   - Verify table relationships

2. WebSocket Connections:
   - Handle reconnection gracefully
   - Implement message queuing
   - Monitor connection status

3. File Uploads:
   - Configure proper MIME types
   - Implement size limits
   - Add progress indicators

# Next Priorities

1. Message Threading:
   - Implement thread UI
   - Add reply functionality
   - Show thread participants

2. File Handling:
   - Add preview capabilities
   - Implement progress tracking
   - Add file type validation

3. User Experience:
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error handling
   - Enhance mobile layout
